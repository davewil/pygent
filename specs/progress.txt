  - Learned: HTMLParser is robust and rarely throws exceptions, making exception fallback hard to test
  - Learned: httpx.AsyncClient context manager pattern with patch requires mocking __aenter__ and __aexit__
  - Web Tools section of Phase 2 now complete
  - Total: 296 tests pass, 96% overall coverage, web.py at 97% coverage

  - Added CSS styling (styles.tcss):
    * Fixed width (24 chars), accent-colored border
    * Hover effect for session items
    * Active session highlighted with primary color and bold text
  - Learned: Textual CSS doesn't support "cursor: pointer" property
  - Learned: DOM manipulation in Textual is asynchronous - need await pilot.pause() after remove() calls in tests
  - Learned: Use query(WidgetClass).remove() pattern for clearing specific widget types

    * Custom commands support via constructor parameter
    * _update_command_list() filters and rebuilds command list on input change
    * on_input_submitted() handler to execute command when Enter pressed in input field
  - Integrated into ChapgentApp:
    * Added ctrl+shift+p keybinding to open command palette
    * action_command_palette() uses push_screen with callback pattern (not push_screen_wait)

  - Learned: push_screen_wait() requires being in a worker context; use callback pattern instead for actions
  - Learned: To query a modal screen in tests, use app.screen instead of app.query_one()
  - Learned: Callbacks from push_screen need asyncio.sleep() in tests to allow execution time
  - Learned: Use call_later() in callbacks to defer action execution outside callback context
  - Added 53 tests:
    * TestPaletteCommand: 8 tests for dataclass and matching
    * TestFuzzyMatch: 7 tests for fuzzy matching helper

    * Tracks tool_id, tool_name, status, start_time, end_time, result, is_error
    * Shows status icon, tool name, elapsed time, and result preview
    * update_status() method for in-place updates when results arrive
    * refresh_elapsed_time() method for periodic timer updates while running
    * CSS classes: tool-progress, tool-progress-{status} for styling each state
    * Truncates long results to 100 chars with "..." suffix
    * Replaces newlines with spaces in display text
  - Updated ToolPanel to track progress items by tool_id:
    * _progress_items dict maps tool_id to ToolProgressItem for in-place updates
    * append_tool_call() creates new ToolProgressItem with RUNNING status
    * update_tool_result() finds existing item by tool_id and updates status
    * update_permission_denied() sets PERMISSION_DENIED status
    * get_running_count() returns number of currently running tools
    * refresh_running_tools() updates elapsed time display for all running tools
    * Legacy append_tool_result() maintained for backwards compatibility
    * clear() now also clears the _progress_items tracking dict
  - Updated conversation_loop to emit timestamps and tool_id in events:
    * tool_call events include timestamp for accurate elapsed time
    * tool_result events include tool_id for matching to progress items
    * permission_denied events include tool_id for proper tracking
  - Updated ChapgentApp.run_agent_loop() to use new ToolPanel methods:
    * Passes start_time from event.timestamp to append_tool_call()
    * Calls update_tool_result() with tool_id, result, is_error, cached
    * Calls update_permission_denied() for permission_denied events
  - Added CSS styling for tool progress states:
    * tool-progress-waiting: muted background for queued tools
    * tool-progress-running: warning color (yellow) for executing tools
    * tool-progress-completed: success color (green) for successful tools
    * tool-progress-error: error color (red) for failed tools
    * tool-progress-cached: accent color for cached results
    * tool-progress-permission_denied: error highlight for denied tools

  - Learned: datetime timestamps are useful for accurate elapsed time calculation
  - Learned: CSS class naming with status.value provides clean status-based styling
  - Learned: Legacy method wrappers maintain backwards compatibility for existing tests
  - Learned: Result preview truncation with newline replacement improves display readability

  - Enhanced SystemPromptSettings model (settings.py):
    * Added content: str | None - direct prompt content
    * Added file: str | None - path to prompt file (supports ~ expansion)
    * Added append: str | None - additional content to append
    * Added mode: Literal["replace", "append"] - how to combine with base
    * Created DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT constant with helpful base prompt
  - Created prompt.py module for prompt loading and template variables:
    * TEMPLATE_VARIABLES dict defining available variables: project_name, project_type, current_dir, git_branch, date, os
    * PromptLoadError exception for file loading failures
    * get_template_variables() - resolves variables from ProjectContext or defaults
    * resolve_template_variables() - replaces {variable} placeholders in content
    * load_prompt_file() - loads prompt from file with ~ expansion
    * get_effective_prompt() - applies all settings (file, content, mode, append) and resolves variables
    * build_full_system_prompt() - combines user settings with project context injection
  - Updated config/__init__.py to export new prompt module functions
  - Wired system prompt into Agent/Provider:
    * Added system_prompt parameter to Agent.__init__
    * Added system_prompt parameter to conversation_loop()
    * System message injected as first message with role="system" in LLM calls

    * TestIntegration: 2 end-to-end tests
  - Learned: Template variable resolution should preserve unknown {variables} rather than raising errors
  - Learned: file parameter takes precedence over content when both are specified
  - Learned: System prompt must be injected at conversation_loop level, not provider level, for proper message ordering
  - Learned: Use Path.expanduser() for ~ expansion in file paths
  - Learned: Pydantic Literal type provides built-in validation for mode parameter
  - System Prompt Customization section of Phase 4 now complete (user/project config, template variables, context injection)

    * _convert_env_value() - converts env strings to appropriate types (int for max_tokens, bool for flags)
    * _load_env_config() - loads all configured env vars into a dict
  - Updated load_config() with new priority order: env vars > project config > user config > defaults
    * Added load_env parameter (default True) to optionally skip env var loading

  - Learned: Boolean conversion should support multiple true-like values: "true", "1", "yes", "on"
  - Learned: monkeypatch.delenv() with raising=False is cleaner for clearing env vars in tests
  - Configuration Polish: Environment Variables section of Phase 4 now complete
  - Total: 927 tests pass
2026-01-18: Implemented Config CLI Commands (src/chapgent/cli.py):

    * Patterns: rate_limit, network, auth, service_unavailable
    * Preserves original_error for debugging
  - Updated LoopEvent dataclass with new fields:
    * error_type: str | None - exception class name
    * error_message: str | None - human-readable message
    * retryable: bool | None - flag for retry decision
  - Wrapped provider.complete() in try/except block in loop.py:
    * Classifies exception using classify_llm_error()
    * Yields llm_error event with error details
    * Exits loop (caller decides whether to retry)
  - Created tests/test_core/test_providers_errors.py with 30 tests:

    * TestLLMSettingsIntegration: 2 end-to-end tests
  - Learned: Textual's Select widget requires options as list of (display, value) tuples
  - Learned: Validation errors should be displayed inline in the modal rather than notifications
  - Learned: Input event handlers (on_input_changed) fire for each keystroke, good for clearing errors
  - Learned: Select.Changed event's value can be Select.BLANK when no selection; must check before using
  - Learned: Saving multiple config values in sequence works well without batching
  - Phase 2.2 of Phase 5 TUI Enhancements complete (LLMSettingsScreen)
  - Total: 1492 tests pass (1491 + 1 new, excluding pre-existing scaffold property test failure)

2026-01-20: Implemented Phase 5 TUI Enhancements - Phase 2.1: ThemePickerScreen (specs/phase-5-tui-enhancements.md):
  - Created src/chapgent/tui/screens.py module:
    * ThemePickerScreen modal for selecting TUI themes
    * Grid of theme buttons (11 themes from VALID_THEMES)
    * Live preview: clicking a theme applies it immediately via self.app.theme
    * Save button persists selected theme to config
    * Cancel button reverts to original theme
    * Escape key binding for cancel action
    * CSS styles embedded in screen class for modal layout
  - Updated src/chapgent/tui/app.py:
    * Added action_show_theme_picker() method
    * Imports ThemePickerScreen from screens module
    * Callback pattern uses save_config_value() from config.writer
    * Displays notification on save/error
  - Updated src/chapgent/tui/widgets.py:
    * Added "Change Theme" command to DEFAULT_COMMANDS
    * id="show_theme_picker", name="Change Theme"
  - Updated src/chapgent/tui/__init__.py:
    * Added screens module exports (ThemePickerScreen)
  - Created tests/test_tui/test_screens.py with 27 tests:
    * TestThemePickerScreen: 5 tests for modal creation and compose
    * TestThemePickerSelection: 2 tests for theme selection and button variants
    * TestThemePickerDismissal: 4 tests for save/cancel/escape behavior
    * TestThemePickerAppIntegration: 4 tests for app integration
    * TestPropertyBased: 2 tests using hypothesis
    * TestEdgeCases: 4 tests for edge cases
    * TestIntegration: 2 end-to-end tests
  - Learned: Textual test pilot.click() fails with OutOfBounds for elements outside visible screen
    * Solution: Use size=(100, 50) in app.run_test() or call internal methods directly
    * Alternative: Use button.press() to simulate button clicks without screen position
  - Learned: Modal screens with nested containers need careful sizing to fit in test viewport
  - Learned: Callbacks from push_screen need asyncio.sleep() to allow execution time in tests
  - Learned: Local imports (inside functions) need to be patched at their source module, not at import site
    * e.g., patch "chapgent.config.writer.save_config_value" not "chapgent.tui.app.save_config_value"
  - Learned: Internal methods (e.g., picker._select_theme()) are useful for testing without UI interaction
  - Phase 2.1 of Phase 5 TUI Enhancements complete (ThemePickerScreen)
  - Total: 1466 tests pass
