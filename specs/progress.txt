2026-01-16: Added comprehensive tests for conversation loop error handling (test_loop.py): unknown tool handling, tool execution exceptions, permission denied flows, message conversion, multiple tool calls, and property-based tests. Also added LLMProvider tool call parsing tests for string/dict JSON args and invalid JSON handling. Coverage improved from 91% to 94%, with core/loop.py and core/providers.py now at 100%.
2026-01-16: Implemented CLI commands (sessions, resume, config). Sessions command lists saved sessions with ID, date, message count, and working directory. Resume command loads an existing session and starts the TUI. Config command displays current configuration. Fixed deprecated asyncio.get_event_loop() usage in property-based tests for Python 3.13 compatibility. Coverage improved to 95%.

2026-01-16: Added comprehensive integration tests for TUI actions (tests/test_integration/test_tui_actions.py) and fixed regressions in existing tests (test_cli.py, test_config.py, test_integration.py). Verified all 86 tests pass.
2026-01-16: Fixed case sensitivity in MockLLMProvider. Filenames now preserve original case for tool calls on Unix systems, while command triggers remains case-insensitive. Updated and added tests to verify fix.

  - Total: 105 tests pass (up from 92), all linting/type checks pass.
2026-01-16: Started Phase 2 - Extended Tools. Implemented grep_search tool (src/pygent/tools/search.py):
  - Supports regex pattern matching in files with ripgrep backend (fast) or pure Python fallback
  - Features: file pattern filtering (glob), case-insensitive search, max results limit, context lines
  - Respects .gitignore-style exclusions (hidden dirs, node_modules, __pycache__, .git, venv)
  - Returns structured JSON results with file, line number, content, and match text

    * Raises FileExistsError if file already exists (intentional, prevents accidental overwrites)
    * Risk level: MEDIUM
  - delete_file: Deletes a single file (HIGH risk)
    * Uses asyncio.to_thread(path.unlink) for non-blocking deletion
    * Raises IsADirectoryError if path is directory (use shell for rmdir)

  - move_file: Moves or renames a file (MEDIUM risk)
    * Uses shutil.move wrapped in asyncio.to_thread for async operation
    * Auto-creates parent directories for destination
    * Raises FileExistsError if destination exists (prevents accidental overwrites)
  - copy_file: Copies a file to new location (MEDIUM risk)
    * Uses shutil.copy2 (preserves metadata: timestamps, permissions)
    * Auto-creates parent directories for destination
    * Raises FileExistsError if destination exists
  - Added 18 unit tests covering: basic operations, nested paths, error cases (not found, is directory, already exists)
  - Added 4 property-based tests using hypothesis: create/delete/move/copy roundtrip verification
  - Learned: Use uuid.uuid4() subdirectories in property tests to avoid state pollution between examples
  - Learned: shutil.copy2 preserves metadata unlike shutil.copy; use asyncio.to_thread to wrap blocking shutil calls
  - Additional File Tools section of Phase 2 now complete
  - Total: 201 tests pass
2026-01-17: Implemented Git Tools (src/pygent/tools/git.py):

  - Learned: Use MagicMock with patch for testing remote operations (push/pull) since no real remote exists
  - Learned: Property tests with hypothesis need careful strategy selection - st.from_regex is cleaner than filter()
  - Git Tools section of Phase 2 now complete
  - Total: 251 tests pass

    * Content type handling (JSON, HTML, plain text)
    * Size limit enforcement
    * Error handling (timeout, connect error, HTTP status error, request error)
    * Custom headers, various HTTP methods
  - Learned: latin-1 encoding can decode any byte sequence (0x00-0xFF), so fallback after latin-1 is unreachable
  - Learned: HTMLParser is robust and rarely throws exceptions, making exception fallback hard to test
  - Learned: httpx.AsyncClient context manager pattern with patch requires mocking __aenter__ and __aexit__
  - Web Tools section of Phase 2 now complete
  - Total: 296 tests pass, 96% overall coverage, web.py at 97% coverage

  - Learned: Add __test__ = False to dataclasses with "Test" in name to prevent pytest collection
  - Learned: Test frameworks often output to stderr (warnings), so combine stdout/stderr for complete results
  - Learned: Use MagicMock with explicit async methods to avoid RuntimeWarning for unawaited coroutines
  - Test Runner section of Phase 3 now complete (framework detection, run_tests tool, output parsing)
  - Total: 477 tests pass
